I am not trying to make this a hardcore Meatboy-type game, I want to introduce challenging moments but I will try to make the difficulty curve as smooth as possible.\n\nThe early game will be pretty chill, just imagine how the Mario games were designed, then newer harder mechanics get slowly introduced.

Link's uncle goes to rescue her first, and Link follows despite his uncle's orders to remain home. His uncle is slain, though beforehand, Link receives a sword and shield from him. Link infiltrates Hyrule Castle and successfully hides Zelda in the Sanctuary as his uncle's last wish.",
